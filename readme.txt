single-page-application-for-buying-prescription-drugs

Created a prototype for Synergix to show to a major high street health retailer. Coded as a single-page application, used AngularJS, pure JavaScript, JSON and HTML5 to create a series of paths the user could go through, answering medical questions to ascertain whether they should be allowed a prescription drug.

Flowchart of the JS code can be seen here.
